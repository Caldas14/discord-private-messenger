   cd discord-private-messenger
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     # Discord Bot Token
     TOKEN2=your_discord_bot_token_here
     
     # Server (Guild) ID where the bot will operate
     GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id_here
     
     # Support role ID that has permission to send messages
     CARGO_SUPORTE_ID=your_support_role_id_here
     ```

4. **Invite the bot to your server**

   ```

## üöÄ Usage

> Send mass DMs, make server-wide announcements, or communicate with specific roles - all with simple commands!

### Commands

- **`/message`**: Starts the process of sending a message to a role
  - Required parameter: `content` - The message you want to send
  - Only members with the support role can use this command

- **`/cancel`**: Cancels an active message interaction
  - Useful if you need to abort the current operation
  - Only members with the support role can use this command

- **`/help`**: Displays all available commands and their descriptions

### Workflow

1. Use `/message` with your message content
2. Select the role you want to send the message to
3. Preview your message and confirm or edit it
4. After sending, view the delivery report showing successful and failed deliveries

### Message Delivery Report

After sending a message, the bot provides a detailed report showing:
- Number of members who received the message
- Number of members who didn't receive the message
- List of users who didn't receive the message (usually because they have DMs disabled)
- The content of the sent message

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Basic Settings
- **Minimum Role Size**: The bot will only show roles with at least 2 members
- **Support Role**: Only members with this role can send messages (configured in `.env`)

### Use Cases
- **Server Announcements**: Send important updates to all members
- **Role Communications**: Target specific groups like VIP members, supporters, or staff
- **Event Notifications**: Inform participants about upcoming events
- **Team Coordination**: Send private instructions to staff members
- **Member Updates**: Notify users about role changes or permissions
- **Community Engagement**: Send personalized messages to active members

## üîí Security Considerations

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- The bot only sends messages to users who allow DMs from server members
- All message sending actions require explicit confirmation

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Bot doesn't respond to commands**: Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions and is online
- **Commands not showing up**: It may take up to an hour for slash commands to register globally
- **Users not receiving messages**: They likely have DMs from server members disabled

### Logs

The bot logs all important events to the console, including:
- Bot startup
- Command registrations
- Message deliveries (successful and failed)
